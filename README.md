### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> <picture><source srcset="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f31f/512.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f31f/512.gif" alt="🌟" width="32" height="32"></picture>

I'm [**Deepnika**](https://deepnika.github.io), a data scientist and software engineer by profession and astrophysics researcher by education. 

I currently work at [**Haidi**](https://haidi.io), where I build end to end solutions for Supply Chain Planning and Operations with main expertise in Time series Forecasting at scale. Previously, I have worked on a range of astronomy and astrophysics projects ranging from compact-object populations (merging binary black holes), three-dimensional structural inference of nearby galaxies (LMC), and the large-scale tidal environment of the Local Group.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following innovative research in STEM fields, mainly astrophysics, computer science, AI and psychology. I unwind by sewing and doing random coding projects.
